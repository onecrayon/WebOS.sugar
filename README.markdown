WebOS.sugar for Espresso
========================

**EARLY DEVELOPMENT VERSION, DO NOT USE**  
If you are interested in helping develop this sugar,
feel free to fork it and experiment. However, very
little functionality is complete at this time, so it's
not suitable for public consumption (only pushed it to
GitHub in case my computer explodes).

<!--The WebOS.sugar provides actions and snippets that make
programming applications for Palm's WebOS easier in the
[Espresso text editor][esp] for Mac.

If you have any requests or stumble across any bugs,
please feel free to [file an issue][issues] or [email
me][contact].-->
