WebOS.sugar for Espresso
========================

The WebOS.sugar allows you to develop your WebOS apps
in the [Espresso][espresso] text editor for Mac.

I developed WebOS.sugar so that I could create [TapNote][tapnote]
in Espresso, and I'm sharing it under an MIT license
so other people can benefit and contribute to it, as well.

**Features**

* Automated common actions (build and run app, launch emulator,
  follow logs, etc.)
* Comprehensive Enyo CodeSense for quicker, easier coding
* Limited Mojo snippets

## Installation

**WebOS.sugar requires [Espresso 2.0][e2] or greater!**

Once Espresso 2.0 is installed, [download the WebOS.sugar][dl],
unzip it, and double click to install.

## Comments and requests

Now that comprehensive Enyo CodeSense is integrated, I consider
the WebOS.sugar feature-complete. If you have any problems,
suggestions, or requests though I would love to hear them.
[Drop me a line](http://onecrayon.com/about/contact/) if you have
feedback.
