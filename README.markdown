WebOS.sugar for Espresso
========================

**EARLY DEVELOPMENT VERSION, DO NOT USE**  
If you are interested in helping develop this sugar,
feel free to fork it and experiment. However, very
little functionality is complete at this time, so it's
not suitable for public consumption (only pushed it to
GitHub in case my computer explodes).

Please note that it also requires the bleeding edge
version of [Spice](http://github.com/onecrayon/Spice-sugar/)
so you'll need to compile and install that before you can
test it.
